# Data Farming
## **Project Proposal**

![Basic Project Outline](/images/project_idea.png)

## **Team Members**
* Carolina
* Jonathan
* Jordan
* Travis

## **Outline**

* Use correlations between weather, USDA crop data, etc. to predict the outcome of the next crop report and make a trading recommendation for either an ETF or a futures contract.
* Use the PyPI Backtesting library to test our strategy.
* Look at the correlation between ETFs and futures contracts to see if one instrument or the other is more sensitive.

## **Research Questions**
* Is there a correlation between reported crop volumes vs. expected crop volumes and futures/ETF pricing?
* Is there a strong correlation between futures market and the respective ETFs?
* Is there a correlation between weather trends (precipitation, temperature, cloud cover(?), etc.) and the reported crop volumes?
* If there is a strong correlation between weather and crop volumes, is Monte Carlo simulation a valid method for predicting the next reported volumes?



## **Datasets to be Used**
* Alpaca API for ETF pricing
* PyPI Backtesting library
* Tradestation/CME/QUANDL API for futures
* USDA crop data
* NOAA weather data
